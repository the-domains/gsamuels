Many people go through ups and downs in their journey. 

Sometimes, in pursuit of the "sweet spot" (what we're good at + what we love + what we get paid for), we may still feel like something's missing. 

Today, someone pointed out the missing fourth element - what the world needs.

You see, I've been able to identify the first 3 for myself over the past 5 years, but that last element eluded me. It reminds me of that famous quote, "Don't ask what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." 

This same element can be applied to job seeking (which I'm doing right now). It doesn't matter how great you are, is there a need or demand for what you have to offer at this very moment? If not, can you make it so?

So, based on your own experiences or interests, what does the world need (now or in the future) that only you can provide?

Enjoy the journey :)
